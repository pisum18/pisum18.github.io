## Introduction

Today I saw a news item about the record natural gas price being broken, at 241 euro per MWh, being more than 10x that of 'normal' prices for this time of the year. The news item made me think about the current economic situation, a topic that has been on my mind intensely, and even more so since the war in Ukraine started on February 24th 2022. Currently, a mix of positive (the Dutch GNP grew by 2.6% in Q2) and negative sounds (inflation above 10% compared to one year ago and scarcity of energy products) emerges. 

I have the impression that most people that I meet don't actually care that much about the current economic situation, and that they don't care so much about the economic prospects. I think that is due to this mix of positive and negative messages about the state of the economy, and the shortsightedness of people in general. In my mind the situation is actually quite severe already, with the potential to get much worse. I have never experienced such a situation in my life. Mind you, I was only 10 years old when the financial crisis of 2007-2008 was happening; I don't know what it is like to live in 'bad' economic conditions.

In this blog article I want to explore the economic situation in the Netherlands, taking into account the strong ties that the Netherlands has with the EU and overseas nations such as China and the USA. I would like to start by giving a short impression of my understanding of the economic situation.

## Some notes on the current (mid August 2022) in the Netherlands

I strongly believe that you should always approach a problem in all its complexities. In line with that idea I want to stay away from characterizing the economy simply by looking at GNP (Gross National Product). It's not that I think this measure of economic activity is useless, but it needs more context to say anything meaningful.

Dutch companies, small, medium and large are creating value from resources, both human and non-human. For many companies the current increase in price of energy, raw materials and agricultural products are seriously challenging their ability to make profit. And to make matters worse, there is not much we can do to alleviate this, at least in the short term. The fact that scarcity of energy drives cost price up for many companies is of immense anxiety to me. 

Besides the increased prices of raw materials and energy, there also seems to be a problem with acquiring sufficient human resources in the Dutch economy. Unemployment is low, although it likely depends on the sector how large the deficit is. Actually, I know nothing about employment statistics so I will refrain from saying anything speculative about it.

In the real economy, prices are increasing enormously, and the public debate focusses heavily on how to deal with this. This debate intrigues me tremendously, so I will spend the next paragraph on discussing my views regarding this questions.

## My views on how to deal with high inflation

I would say that my views on how to deal with high inflation are unconventional, maybe even controversial. In my mind, economics has everything to do with psychology and sociology. Actually, I think high inflation should be solved mostly by addressing human behaviour, which is something that I hear too little of in the public debate. 

Why do I mention this? I think I have good reasons for this. It's actually quite simple, because it's people that run the economy. People that decide in the board rooms of large corporations, and people that make decisions on the workfloor every day. Mums and dads that make decisions at the dinner table about large purchases, or grandparents that decide what to put in their shopping cart at the store. It is the processes of human decisionmaking that determine the dynamics of an economy.

Yet in the newspaper or on the radio, the economic stories are all about projections of future economic growth, and projections of future inflation. There are no stories about the role of human decisionmaking in the dynamics of an economy. It's all numbers and the assumptions underlying the models that yield those numbers, they're not shared, and they're not discussed. At the same time I advocate that these kind of complicated discussions stay out of the newspapers and out of the media. It's too difficult to dive deep into this. On the other hand I would strongly advocate to invite more sociologists and psychologists to join the discussion about the economy, since they are the experts on the topic of human behaviour. I believe that their perspectives will enhance the debate.
