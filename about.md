## Who am I?

Hi there! I was born in the year 1998. This means that so far, I have lived in 2 centuries and 4 millennia. If I really look after my health, and have a good dose of luck I might even live into the 2100s.

I am a scientist by training. 


## What do I do?

Currently I am looking for a challenging PhD position to further develop myself as an independent scientific researcher.

To prepare myself for the endeavour I am currently maintaining my bioinformatic skills by doing courses on Datacamp, and by working on this website. I am learning more about Vim, Git and Markdown as I go.


## Why this website?

The first time I seriously thought about starting a website (although at that stage I wanted to run it locally), the purpose was to make it some sort of information collection hub for myself. Separate from this idea, I had also been wanting to write reviews of books that I read, but I had not started doing that yet. Another idea emerged more recently: I wanted to learn more about a few common open source tools namely Git, Markdown and Vim, but I had not reason to start using those tools.

The three ideas presented above are a good summary of what drove me to start this website. I had been dreaming of making my own website for a long time, and I also wanted to write reviews for books that I read. Without a clear purpose however, I would not start working on this. Learning Git, Vim and Markdown in the process of making this website was the final push that made me start.

I am happy that I made that decision.

## What are my future plans?

For this website my plan is simple: slowly expand the number of book reviews on this website as I read more books. Count on maybe one review every 2 months or so (so ~6 reviews per year). I will also give an update on my thoughts about the website once a year. If I have any new plans for the website, I will let you know in the update.

In my personal life, the plan is not simple, but it is straightforward: I want to become a better scientist and grow as a person. I have this vision of being a smart, nuanced geek that is able to contribute meaningfully to discussions by asking sharp, revealing questions that bring the conversation forward. I am working towards that goal every single day.
