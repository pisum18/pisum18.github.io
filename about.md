## Who am I?

Hi there! I was born in the year 1998. This means that so far, I have lived in 2 centuries and 4 millennia. If I really look after my health, and have a good dose of luck I might even live into the 2100s.

I am a scientist by training. Nowadays, I have moved away from this and started a career in software. 


## What do I do?

I am currently working at a local company as a software engineer in a small team. I am performing a wide range of programming tasks including working with AI models, creating user interfaces with WPF and programming PLCs using Arduino!


## Why this website?

The first time I seriously thought about starting a website (although at that stage I wanted to run it locally), the purpose was to make it some sort of information collection hub for myself. Separate from this idea, I had also been wanting to write reviews of books that I read, but I had not started doing that yet. Another idea emerged more recently: I wanted to learn more about a few common open source tools namely Git, Markdown and Vim, but I had not reason to start using those tools. As soon as I found out how easy it was to host a website using Github Pages, I put this one online!

## What are my future plans?

For this website my plan is simple: slowly expand the number of book reviews on this website as I read more books. ~~Count on maybe one review every 2 months or so (so ~6 reviews per year).~~ Update after 2 years of not doing anything on this site: life will get in the way. I will give no guarantees whatsoever regarding when I will post what...

In my personal life, the plan is not simple, but it is straightforward: I want to become smarter every day. I have this vision of being a smart, nuanced geek that is able to contribute meaningfully to discussions by asking sharp, revealing questions that bring the conversation forward. I am working towards that goal every single day.
